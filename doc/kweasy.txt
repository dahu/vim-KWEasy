1. INTRODUCTION                                             *kweasy-intro*

Vim-KWEasy lets you jump to the very character you've got your eyeballs on!

Look at the character on the screen that you want to land on and then press
<leader>k followed by that character. The window will be replaced with an
overlay containing the positions of your desired character, ordered from the
top of the window down. The character you were looking at has now been
replaced by, say, the number 3 or the letter a, or the symbol :.  Whatever it
is, press it now and your original buffer contents reappears and your cursor
is moved to that location.

Regular Expression Searches with KWEasy~

If you'd rather show the hints for a full-blown regex, use <leader>s instead.

Rationale~

Vim has a lot of ways to move the cursor. For long-distance jumps, that
vim-KWEasy was designed for, traditional Vim advice is to /search for the
object you want to land on. This has two drawbacks: 1. it pollutes your search
history (and if you have |'hlsearch'| enabled, it creates a new distraction),
and 2. there may be several same-patterned objects between your cursor and
where you want to go, requiring you to cycle through them with |n| or |N|.
vim-KWEasy assigns a unique identifier for each occurrence of the selected
letter you want to jump to, and it's independent of your cursor, so such
cycling isn't required.

Of course, vim-KWEasy can also be used for shorter distance jumps that are
traditionally handled by the |f||F||t||T||,||;| keys (or the awesome plugin,
https://github.com/dahu/vim-fanfingtastic atop those keys.)

2. CONFIGURATION                                        *kweasy-configuration*

You can change the default KweasyJump map (<leader>k) with a line like this in
your ~/.vimrc:
>
  nmap <leader>f <Plug>KweasyJump
<

You can change the default KweasySearch map (<leader>s) with a line like this
in your ~/.vimrc:
>
  nmap <leader>F <Plug>KweasySearch
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         *'kweasy_nolist'*
                                                       *'g:kweasy_nolist'*
Values: boolean
Default: 0                                                                   ~

By default, vim-KWEasy doesn't disable the |'list'| option when displaying
hints because doing so can cause slight offset glitches.

Make vim-KWEasy disable |'list'| by adding the following line to your $MYVIMRC:
>
  let g:kweasy_nolist = 1
<

                                                          *'kweasy_hints'*
                                                        *'g:kweasy_hints'*
Values: string
Default: asdfg;lkjh

Vim-KWEasy uses 88 keyboard characters as the on-screen hints for where to
jump (previously referred to as "jump-marks"). By default, these hints are the
set: [a-z,A-Z,0-9,punctuation] with the letters "asdfg;lkjh" moved to the
front. Change the value of 'g:kweasy_hints' to alter which hints get displayed
first.

Make vim-KWEasy show digits first by adding the following line to your $MYVIMRC:
>
  let g:kweasy_hints = '0123456789'
<
